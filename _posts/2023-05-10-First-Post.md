# Hopes and Dreams
My hope is that this website will be a place for me to share any thoughts I have, projects I am working on, CTF challenges I've solved, or any other odds and ends that I see fit to write about. A sort of fleeting glance into the mind, if you will. 

I hope that anyone that stumbles across this site finds the information informative, entertaining, and insightful. Hopefully a bit of everything. If for whatever reason you'd like to get in touch, please see the bottom of the [about](/about) page for further instruction.

Software Engineer. Purdue cybersecurity grad. Loves all things offensive security, networking, linux, and homelab related, and as a result, is always working on something. Enjoys competing in CTFs and is especially interested in the pwn category. Former webmaster and president of the [b01lers](https://b01lers.com) CTF Team. Likes pi√±a coladas and getting caught in the rain.

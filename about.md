Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at Purdue University. Loves all things offensive security, networking, linux, and homelab related, and as a result, is always working on something. Enjoys competing in CTFs and is especially interested in the pwn category. Former Webmaster and current President of the [b01lers](https://b01lers.com) CTF Team. Former Team Leader and Team Supervisor for [Boiler Gold Rush](https://www.purdue.edu/orientation/bgr/). Likes pi√±a coladas and getting caught in the rain.
